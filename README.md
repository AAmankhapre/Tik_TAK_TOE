# Tik_TAK_TOE
an AI game of tic tac toe that never loses. To narrow the search space, this programme combines the minimax method with alpha-beta pruning.

A recursive process known as the minimax algorithm is used to decide the next move in an n-player game, typically a back-and-forth game between two players. Every position in the game and every state has a value. The position evaluation function was used to calculate this value, which represents how good it would be for a player to hold that position. The next move the player makes maximises the minimum value of the position as a result of the opponent's potential next move. A assigns a value to each of his legal moves if it is his turn to move.

The minimax algorithm, which is summarised here, deals with games like tic-tac-toe where each player has the option of winning, losing, or drawing. The winning move made by player A is his best move if he can win in one action. Player B's best move is the one that results in a draw if she knows that one move will put her opponent in a position where she can win in one move and another move would put her opponent only in a position where she can draw. It's simple to choose the "best" move late in the game. By working backwards from the game's conclusion, the Minimax algorithm assists in determining the best play. It is assumed that Player A is attempting at each phase.
